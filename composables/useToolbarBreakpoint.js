/**
 * Drives the toolbar's three-tier layout: mobile / tablet / desktop.
 *
 * This replaces a single Tailwind `sm:` (640px) on/off toggle that turned
 * out not to be enough — real testing (see the iPhone-width and 956px
 * screenshots that prompted this) showed the FULL toolbar (nav + info +
 * search + contents + archive + sign-in) still overflows the viewport at
 * 956px, nowhere near "mobile" by any reasonable definition, but still too
 * narrow for everything to sit inline without cutting off. Rather than
 * guess at one wider breakpoint, the toolbar now has three explicit tiers
 * to render against, each showing a deliberately chosen amount inline
 * before folding the rest into the retractable menu — see EpaperToolbar.vue
 * for exactly what's assigned to each tier.

  // breakpoint literally called 'tablet', with nothing actually named

  // explicit, not just numerically correct.

                    // everything inline; 1280px is where it's confirmed to
